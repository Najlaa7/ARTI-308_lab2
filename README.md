The lab focuses on identifying the machine learning problem type, selecting a suitable open dataset, loading and inspecting the data using Python, and designing a methodology diagram that outlines the complete machine learning workflow.


This project addresses a supervised machine learning problem focused on predicting house prices based on various property features. The dataset contains information about residential houses, including attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, number of floors, year built, and location details.
The target variable in this problem is price, which represents the selling price of a house. Since the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value, this is a regression problem.
The model is expected to learn the relationship between the input features (house characteristics) and the target variable (price). By analyzing patterns in the training data, the model should be able to estimate the price of a house given its features. The objective is to build a model that can make accurate predictions and generalize well to unseen data.
